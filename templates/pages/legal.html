                    <p>
                        In no event shall MedicalStore or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, 
                        damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability 
                        to use the materials on MedicalStore's website, even if MedicalStore or a MedicalStore authorized representative 
                        has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
